      <description>About me Hi there! Iâ€™m a front-end web developer with a background in fine arts. In university, I majored in art, and I loved it! I focused on creating works using photography. I&amp;rsquo;m so grateful that all the creativity and aesthetic sense I developed during that time have been so valuable in my current role. After graduating, I had the pleasure of working as a freelance Japanese-German translator. My passion for technology eventually led me to self-study programming, and in 2023, I started my career as a web developer.</description>
