## About me

Hi there! I’m a front-end web developer with a background in fine arts. In university, I majored in art, and I loved it! I focused on creating works using photography. I'm so grateful that all the creativity and aesthetic sense I developed during that time have been so valuable in my current role. After graduating, I had the pleasure of working as a freelance Japanese-German translator. My passion for technology eventually led me to self-study programming, and in 2023, I started my career as a web developer. I'm really passionate about front-end development, and I'm particularly skilled in React.

I've been having a lot of fun lately learning more about Linux. I love how flexible and in control it makes me feel! I’m always on the lookout for new technologies and ways to improve my skills so I can create the best web applications possible.

Welcome to my blog! This is a record of what I’ve learned in my daily development work. I hope my posts are helpful to you and provide some inspiration.

Since my native language is Japanese, there might be some unclear parts, mistakes, or unnatural expressions in my English writing. Thank you for your understanding.

If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me. I'm always happy to hear from you!
